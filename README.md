# Structure

This monorepo is designed to allow all my bevy projects to be under one git repo.

Each project will have its own README detailing the development process day by day.

# Collisionz

##### Goals

Make a game where you have a square and grey squares spawn.
When you collide the squares join you.
If you collide with an enemy, the squares die.

I think I want to use Egui for the ui and Rapier for the collision detections.
Egui and Egui_bevy did not work out. The error I was having with Bevy 9 didn't seem fixable.

Decided to use KayakUi.
